Work in partners to make a virtual world or roleplaying game.
  
Each is worth one letter grade:

1) Track Player Location and Display It. (Any way you want - each of these is
pretty open ended.)
2) 5 puzzles that the player must solve to win, using 5 functions.

3) There must be some sort of "combat", with something resembling health and
levels (i.e. the player must grow stronger over time). It must roll random
numbers for combat.

4) Dialogue - the player must have 20 or more lines of spoken dialogue in the
virtual world. AI controlled players (NPCs) must have 20 or more lines of
spoken dialogue. These lines should all be different, not copy-pasted. These
lines should all be different, not copy-pasted.

5) Worldbuilding - You must have 40+ sentences of description in your world.
You must do this even if you build your project in Unity or Unreal Engine, and
not text-based on the server.

6) Extra Credit - Do one or more of the following: A) An inventory system, B)
Have some music that you composed yourself, C) A world map the user can walk
around on.

If you are interested in more advanced coding, I have included source code for
a scrollable world map. Type "make" to build the project instead of "compile".
