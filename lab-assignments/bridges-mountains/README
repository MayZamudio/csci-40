=================================================

For this assignment, you will use the BRIDGES library to visualize pathfinding
your way through the mountains of Colorado. BRIDGES is a neat library, funded
by the NSF, that helps new programmers out by allowing them to visually see
the results of their work.

Your goal will be: given a starting row you will start on the left side of the
map and move one column at a time until you reach the right. At every tile,
you must look at the three square to the right, and choose the one that is
closest in elevation to your current spot, and move to it, AND SET ITS
ELEVATION TO -1.

The reason for this is that mountains are much easier to walk around than to
go over.

To get an A on this assignment you must:
1) (Three grades) Write a greedy algorithm that pathfinds from the starting
location to the end, minimizing the total vertical distance travelled

2) (One grade) Write a blue line (yes, you'll need to change the color from the staring
code on the map showing the route taken, and visualize it on
BRIDGES (this bit is done for you, so just don't break it). You must also
change the title of the BRIDGES visualizaton from Greedy to Dijkstra's.

3) (One grade) You must use the NOAA grid extract tool to download elevation data for some
region on earth and run your algorithm on it. Go here:
http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/wcs-client/, select a region, choose to save
it as an ArcGIS ASCII Grid and then download it. Use WinSCP (or another SCP
tool if you use a Mac or GNU/Linux box) to transfer the file into your
directory, and then run it by typing "a.out filename" where filename is the
name of the file you downloaded. BRIDGES has given with two input files,
colorado1.dat and colorado2.dat, that you can use to test your code. Look at
how colorado1.dat is formated and make the file you download match that
format. It's pretty easy, but it won't work as you have downloaded it. I have
made maps for Tahoe and for the whole Central Valley.

To get a grade, you must allow me to run your code on all five maps (the four
ones I've given you and the one you created.) Don't crash on the map of the
Central Valley! There's a bug in the BRIDGES code you need to fix without
editing the map file. It's throwing an exception on line 120 on that map. Why?

To get BRIDGES working, you must register on their website to get a username
and API key. Enter these into the source code on the first couple lines of
main where you see variables for your name and API key. You can pick any
assignment number you want - I'm using 1001 for this one. The code is set to
not compile until you get a BRIDGES account, using a static assert.

Hopefully you will learn lots of things by seeing how other people write code.
Every instution has its own style and way of doing things.
