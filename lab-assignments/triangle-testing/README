            Triangle Testing
========================================

Your program will be very simple, in fact main is already done for you, and you only need to write a single function. This function will take in the length of the three sides of a triangle (three floats) and return if the given triangle is:
A) Equilateral (3 equal sides)
B) Isoceles (2 equal sides)
C) Right (one of the interior angles is pi/2 radians, i.e. 90 degrees)
D) Other (a triangle not one of the above)
E) Error (the input doesn't describe a valid triangle)

Resolve conflicts in the order above, so if it is both isoceles and right then return isoceles, for example.

The triangle sides are not in any particular order.
