Homework - In your "simple_calculator" directory
  
You will write a program that will enable a user to do simple mathematical calculations.

You must do it from scratch - don't forget the magic!

It will need to do the following:

1. Prompt the user with the following string: "1) addition 2) subtraction 3) multiplication 4) division: "

2. Input their choice into an integer variable named whatever you want.

3. Prompt them with the following string: "Please enter two numbers: "

4. Input two integers from the keyboard into two variables called whatever you want.

5. Do the math of their choice (i.e. if they typed 2 8 5, you will subtract (choice 2) 8 and 5).

6. Output the result to the screen and quit.

BONUS POINTS!

7. Validate the input - NO DIVISION BY ZERO (or modulus by zero) and check to
make sure they typed a number between 1 and 4 for the operator.

If they gave a bad input: output "BAD INPUT!" and quit.

8. Add modulus as option #5. Don't change the prompt (in #1), it will be a
secret easter egg. Also modify #7 so it doesn't output BAD INPUT! on a 5.
