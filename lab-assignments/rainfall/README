Soloway's Rainfall Problem is one of the most studied homework assignments in
computer science history, with papers on student performance on it dating back
to the 1980s. Now is your chance to demonstrate your prowess compared to other
CS1 students!

The assignment is actually pretty easy - you are given rainfall data from a
weather monitoring station, and you need to output the average daily rainfall
the station receives.

The number input represents millimeters of rain for one day. All numbers in this assignment are integers.

Start by printing the following string:
"Please enter daily rainfall data (-1 to quit):\n"

Do this in a loop:
ZZ
1) Read in integers from the keyboard
2) If the number is -1, terminate the loop
3) If the number is a negative other than -1, discard it and read another integer
4) If the number is 0 or positive, add it to a vector of integers.
5) If they type in a non-integer, quit the program and print "BAD INPUT!\n"

After the loop finishes, enter a second loop which prompts the user with the
following:

1) Average daily rainfall
2) Average rainfall on rainy days
3) Count of days that had rain
4) Maximum rainfall
5) Top 5 days of rain
6) Quit
When they select their choice, you will print the requested data to the
screen, and then enter the menu again. If they type in a number not 1-4 you
will terminate the loop and quit the program. Rather than doing a division by
0, (for example average rainfall on rainy days with 0 rainy days) print "NO
DATA\n";

For the top 5 days of rain, you will print the most rain on the first line of
output, the second most rain on the second line, etc. If there has been no
rain, print "NO DATA\n". If there is between 1 and 4 days of rain, print what
data is available.
