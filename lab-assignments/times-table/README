On paper and parchment they taught me to write,
In Euclid and Grammar they opened my eyes,
And in Multiplication in truth I was bright,
Agus fágaimíd siúd mar atá sé.

================================================

Do you remember seeing times tables back in 2nd grade?

For this assignment, you will generate addition and multiplication tables for
use in a classroom. At every step along the way, you must vet the input from
the user, and if they type something bad, you must quit the program with a
"BAD INPUT!" error message.

Step 1) The user will input if they want to make an addition table or
multiplication table. They will type a 1 for addition or 2 for multiplication.
Possible Errors: The user types in something that is not an integer, or the
user types something other than 1 or 2.

Step 2) The user will enter what the minimum and maximum numbers on the table
are (these are inclusive, so if they type in 1 and 12, it will have all
numbers from 1 to 12 on the times table)
Possible Errors: The user types in something not an integer, the user types in
a minimum greater than the maximum, the user types in something that will
result in a table being bigger than 20x20 (the maximum size allowed)

Step 3) You will output a + or a X, if you are doing addition or
multiplication, respectively. You will then output all the column headers on
the top row.
Then you will print each row. Each row will have a row header, followed by the
results in each entry in the table. Each entry in the table will be separated
by a tab ("\t") character.
Possible Errors: None. This phase has no input. But if you screw up the
formatting or don't get the headers done right, it will not pass the
autograder.

Pro Tip: Try just getting a normal times table (from 1 to 12) working before
doing the rest of the assignment.
