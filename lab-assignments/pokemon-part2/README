You teach me and I'll teach you - Pokémon!

Part 2 is to implement Pokémon battling!

You should have finished part 1 before doing
this. Copy your main.cc over from your
previous folder: cp ../pokemon/main.cc .

Unlike part 1, this is not autograded.
You will be graded based on how much of
the Pokémon ruleset you implement.

To get an A you must do the following:

========================================
1) The user must select two Pokémon to battle, using either
index or name (or both)

The user must select up to four moves for each Pokémon.
Moves should be selected by index or name (or both).
If they don't select any moves, give the Pokémon 'Struggle'.

2) The higher speed Pokémon will go first. On a tie, flip a
coin. After that the Pokémon alternate turns.

3) The user will select a move for the active Pokémon.
It will do damage to the defending Pokémon.
If the defending Pokémon reaches 0 hp, the attacker wins!

The formula for damage is this:
(power * attack)/defense * STAB * type_modifier

Explanation:
Power   - the power of the move (found in the move database)
Attack  - the attack stat of the attacking pokemon
Defense - the defense stat of the defending pokemon
STAB    - see below
type_modifier - see below
========================================
4) STAB

If the type of the move matches the type of the pokemon, it will do +50% bonus
damage. It can match on either type (so a fire move by a fire/ice pokemon would get
the +50% bonus damage)

If STAB applies, the multiplier is 1.5x
If the types don't match, multiplier is 1x

========================================

5) Implement the type system from Pokémon.
 If a Pokémon has the same type as the move it is
 doing it should do 50% more damage. Some attacking types deal
 extra damage or less damage to defending types, as shown here:
 https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart#Generation_I
 I have copied the values into a file called "type_system.txt" for
 you that you can use to look up the damage modifiers.

I will give you a function that tells you which type corresponds to which
row/column of the table (look at mapdemo.cc).

========================================

Extra Credit:
An extra letter grade is available for implementing an "adventure mode"
in which the player starts with one of four basic Pokémon and battles
other, randomly generated, Pokémon over time. The player can either
run away or fight it. If they fight it and win, it gets added to their
roster of Pokémon they can use in a fight. If they lose, they die.

Another letter grade is available if you make a top-down map that
the user can walk around in OR if you add in extra mechanics for
greater fidelity to the games, such as invisible values (IVs) and
effort values (EVs), experience, evolutions, etc.
