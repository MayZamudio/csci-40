==============================================

Introduction: This is an open-ended assignment in which you and your partner
will be able to exercise both your programming skills and artistic side.

I have given you operational code that will apply two image filters to an
image. You should compile it (using "make" instead of "compile") and run it
("a.out chenonceau.jpg") to get a feel for how it works: it will output the following:
1) The time it took to load the image
2) The time it took to darken it by 50%
3) The time it took to sepia-tone it
4) The time it took to write the file to disk

The output file is called output.jpg (and isn't especially high quality).

You can use an SCP client (like WinSCP if you are on Windows) to transfer
files to and from your directory and test the code on any image you upload,
and then download output.jpg and view the result.

Your tasks:

1) First, you must think of some other sort of image filter you might want to
write, and then write it. Replace either the darken code or the sepia code
with your new filter. The cooler the filter, the more points you will get, with
up to a letter grade of extra credit for something super awesome.

2) Second, do the same for the other filter.

3) Third, you must draw your logo somewhere on the screen as a watermark to
show who made the image. This can be as simple as doing a small red triangle in
the bottom left corner, or as complicated as a signature. It should overwrite
whatever image data was there before, and be visible to the naked eye.
Extra Credit: More complicated logos can be awarded bonus points

4) Finally, you must hide a secret message somewhere in the image, with a
hashtag prepending it. The message itself is your choice, but it doesn't need to
be longer than a word or two. You can hide it however you want, but the message
must be recoverable by a third party somehow.

Grading:
You will earn one letter grade for each bullet point above, up to a maximum of a B (80%)
before the extra credit is applied.

In order to get an A or above, your project must be artistically impressive. We will bring
in a panel of guest judges to give you an "artistic score" to go with your "technical
score", like in ice skating. I recommend you think carefully about what image you choose
to apply your filters to, and to the overall aesthetic of your image afterward. It is possible
to create amazing art with relatively few lines of code, but most successful projects put
a lot of time into experimenting with their code to get exactly the right effect they want.

Note: If your color data overflows, it will likely get a zero for the artistic score, so make sure
you write code that will prevent your RGB values from exceeding 255 or falling below 0.
