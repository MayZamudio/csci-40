For this program, you will learn to combine for loops with if statements, and
use modulus as well. If you know functions, they will help.

All strings have newlines at the end.

Step 1. Ask the user how high they want the program to count. Output exactly
this (capitalization and everything):
Please enter a number that you want to count up to in Mandarin.

Step 2. Ask the user what number they want to start with. Output:
Please enter what number to start with:
  
Step 3. Ask the user what step size they want to count up by. Output:
What step size do you want to use?

After each step, you will input an integer from the standard input (i.e. you
will cin >> into an integer).

Your program will then output the numbers in both Arabic numerals and in
Mandarin.

For example, if you want to count to 10, starting at one, with a step size of
two, your program will output this:
1 yi
3 san
5 wu
7 qi
9 jiu

We will not output anything past this, since the next number is over 10.

Mandarin Dictionary:
0 - ling 
1 - yi    
2 - er   
3 - san 
4 - se
5 - wu       
6 - liu
7 - qi
8 - ba
9 - jiu
10 - shi 

To count numbers over 10, use the following rules: 
    
For numbers 11 through 19, it is shi followed by the digit above:
11 - shi yi
12 - shi er
13 - shi san
etc.

For numbers 20 through 99, it is the first digit followed by shi followed by
the second digit (except 0):
33 - san shi san
52 - wu shi er
80 - ba shi

For numbers over a hundred, it follows the same pattern. 167 in Mandarin is
literally "1 hundreds, 6 tens, 7" or "yi bai liu shi qi". 420 in Mandarin is
"4 hundreds 2 tens" or "si bai er shi". Same goes for thousands - 1234 is
literally "one thousand 2 hundred three ten four" or "yi qian er bai san shi
si". And so forth for wan (10,000s). Don't worry about digits over wan.
100 - bai
1000 - qian
10000 - wan

ERROR CHECKING:
If the user ever makes an error on input, print "BAD INPUT!" to the screen and
quit.

Types of errors:
1) Typing in something not an integer
2) Having the start be higher than the end
3) Having negative numbers
4) Having numbers over 99999
