This is a timed event!

You have to write five functions as quickly as possible. Open main.cc and
you'll see five places where there is a comment saying //YOU

Write the function signature around the YOU, for example:
double f(double x) {
    //YOU
}

And then fill in the missing code where it says YOU

When you think you're done, type input_tester and see if you are.
